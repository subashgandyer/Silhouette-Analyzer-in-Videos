# Silhouette-Analyzer-in-Videos

This repo contains code, slides, docs of my Masters Thesis titled "Silhouette Analysis of Humans in Videos".

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a classification system that will classify different people that comes into a room using their dress information alone.

## Description

A live video feed of people entering room is given as input. Images are extracted from the video and foreground object is extracted. Color information of the dress he was wearing is extracted and a histogram is built. This is the feature that will discriminate different people entering the premise. This is my Masters’ thesis titled “Silhouette Analysis of Humans in Videos”. 

## Input & Output

Input : Video feed of random people entering a room

Output: Who entered and how many times and when a person entered the room

## Tools Used: 

* C++

* OpenCV
